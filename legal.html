                    <h2>1. Information only — not legal advice</h2>
                    <p>GlassCase is a project of Jay Spudvilas (Jayden Spudvilas-Powell), operating in a personal capacity. References to "GlassCase" and "we" on this site refer to this project and its author. GlassCase is not a registered legal entity.</p>
                    <p>GlassCase.org is a civic-legal data lab. It publishes tools, taxonomies and guidance for analysing administrative processes, FOI redactions and transparency systems.</p>
                    <p>Nothing on this site is legal, financial or professional advice, and using this site does not create a solicitor-client or advisory relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the <a href="/consideration-matrix">Consideration Matrix</a>, <a href="/redaction-taxonomy">Redaction Taxonomy</a>, <a href="/stress-mapper">Institutional Stress Mapper</a>, and any future tools published on this site. If you need advice, you should seek independent advice from a qualified professional in your jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="/commentary">Governance by Design commentary series</a> analyses administrative law cases and processes for educational purposes. Commentary references legislation and court decisions for analytical context only. It does not constitute legal advice, case commentary for use in proceedings, or authoritative legal analysis. Accuracy is intended but cannot be guaranteed. Views expressed are those of the author and should not be relied upon as a substitute for independent legal research.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://lightkey.org">LightKey</a> is a GlassCase initiative delivered as a separate site. Its pathway guides are educational resources only and are subject to the same limitations described on this page. <a href="https://lightkey.org/legal/">LightKey</a>, <a href="https://jayspudvilas.com/legal/">jayspudvilas.com</a> and <a href="https://lawandlearning.com/legal">Law &amp; Learning</a> have their own terms and privacy notices.</p>
                    <p>Future tools, including the FOI Process Visualiser and Procedural Fairness Simulator, are designed as educational resources, not professional advisory tools.</p>
                    <p>Unless clearly stated otherwise, all views are those of the project lead (Jay Spudvilas) and do not represent any current or past employer, agency or organisation.</p>

                    <p>We aim to keep information accurate and up to date, but we cannot guarantee completeness or that everything remains current over time. Law changes. Legislation is amended. Court decisions evolve the interpretation of statutory provisions. Content on this site may not reflect the most recent developments.</p>
                    <p>This page and all site content may be updated at any time without notice. The full version history of this site is publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/nuncprotunc/glasscase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, where you can review what changed and when.</p>
                    <p>All content, tools and resources on this site are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
                    <p>Use of this site is at your discretion. To the extent permitted by law, GlassCase is not liable for any loss, damage or costs arising from your use of, or reliance on, this site or any linked resources. Nothing in this notice excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantee or other right that cannot be excluded under Australian law, including under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00109/latest/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Consumer Law</a>.</p>
                    <p>Tools and taxonomies are designed for comparative analysis and transparency auditing. They are not substitutes for statutory interpretation or official guidance. The <a href="https://glasscase.org/stress-mapper">Institutional Stress Mapper</a> produces diagnostic signals based on user-entered assessments. Output reflects the data entered by the user, not validated findings, and has not been independently verified. It should not be treated as evidence of institutional conduct. Statutory mappings and exemption references are provided for educational context only. They may be incomplete, simplified, or superseded by legislative amendment. Always verify against current legislation.</p>

                    <h2>4. Privacy, analytics &amp; cookies</h2>
                    <p>This site uses Google Analytics and Ahrefs Analytics to understand aggregate traffic and usage patterns. We do not use these tools for advertising or behavioural profiling.</p>
                    <p>This site functions fully without cookies or JavaScript. You can block all analytics tracking through your browser settings or extensions and lose no functionality.</p>
                    <p>These services use cookies and similar technologies to collect information such as page views, referrers, approximate location, device and browser information and IP addresses. We use this information in aggregate to understand how the site is used and to improve the content. We do not sell personal data, combine analytics data with other data to profile named individuals, or attempt to re-identify people from analytics data.</p>
                    <p>If you contact us, we will take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify any logs we can associate with you, subject to technical limits and legal record-keeping requirements. These providers may process information on servers outside Australia (for example, in the United States or the European Union). You can learn more about these services in their own privacy materials:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We process analytics data on the basis of legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) — specifically, our interest in understanding how the site is used so we can maintain and improve it. Under the Australian Privacy Act, this collection falls within the "reasonably expected" secondary purpose exception (APP 6.2(a)). You can opt out at any time by blocking cookies or JavaScript through your browser settings or extensions such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger.</p>
                    <p>This site links to third-party subscription services (LinkedIn, Substack). Email data provided through those services is governed by their respective privacy policies, not by this notice.</p>
                    <p>We access and use analytics data in aggregate form only. Google Analytics event data is retained for 14 months. Ahrefs operates as an independent data controller; we do not retain personal data from Ahrefs — see their privacy policy above for their own retention practices. Contact form submissions and inbox correspondence are retained for up to 24 months, unless an ongoing professional relationship exists. Contact forms on this site are processed by <a href="https://formspree.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree</a>, which acts as a data processor on our behalf (<a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree Privacy Policy</a>).</p>
                    <p>Each site we operate (glasscase.org, lightkey.org, lawandlearning.com, jayspudvilas.com) uses its own separate Google Analytics property. There is no cross-domain tracking and no cross-site aggregation of analytics data.</p>
                    <p>Although the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme under Part IIIC of the Privacy Act may not apply to this project directly, we voluntarily commit to notifying affected users of any significant data breach that we become aware of and that is likely to affect their personal information.</p>
                    <p>This site is not directed at children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
                    <p>You can contact us to ask what personal information, if any, we hold about you. If you believe any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you can contact us to request correction. If you believe we have handled your personal information in a way that breaches your privacy, you can contact us to make a complaint and we will respond within 30 days.</p>

                    <h2>5. Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>GlassCase publishes specialist tools and analysis. The content is necessarily detailed and assumes familiarity with administrative law concepts.</p>
                    <p>We design for structural clarity — consistent navigation, logical hierarchy and readable typography — but we recognise that this material is complex by nature. Where we can simplify without losing precision, we do.</p>
                    <p>For accessible, step-by-step versions of the processes GlassCase analyses, see <a href="https://lightkey.org">LightKey</a>, our public pathway initiative built with particular attention to users with dyslexia, anxiety and cognitive fatigue.</p>
