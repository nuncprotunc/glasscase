        <h1>Stress Mapper Methodology</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Technical note on construct design, scoring logic, weighting rationale, and limitations for the GlassCase Institutional Stress Mapper.</p>

        <h2>1. Purpose and scope</h2>
        <p>The Institutional Stress Mapper is a <strong>structured triage tool</strong> for detecting patterns of institutional stress over time. It supports comparative pattern detection and prioritisation. It does not establish factual findings, legal conclusions, or diagnoses.</p>
        <p>The tool is designed for use by oversight practitioners, researchers, educators, and anyone seeking to structure their interpretation of observable institutional signals. It sits in the tradition of risk-based regulatory triage — identifying where deeper inquiry may be warranted, not determining what happened or why.</p>

        <div class="note-box">
            <strong>What this tool is not.</strong> It is not an audit. It is not an assessment. It does not claim measurement precision. Scores represent user judgement based on observable proxy indicators, not validated findings. Output is not suitable for use as evidence in legal, regulatory, or administrative proceedings without independent professional verification.
        </div>

        <h2>2. Stress, not trauma</h2>
        <p>The tool deliberately measures <strong>stress</strong>, not trauma. This distinction matters. Stress is a load condition — observable, measurable, and present in all organisations at varying levels. Trauma is a downstream consequence that occurs when stress exceeds institutional capacity over time. The literature supports this framing: Vivian and Hormann's work on organisational trauma (2013) developed a phenomenological framework for understanding how trauma enters and moves through organisations, identifying distinct entry points for trauma and entry points for healing. Their model treats trauma as the object of study — the outcome. This tool treats stress as the measured variable and references trauma only as a potential downstream consequence.</p>
        <p>This is not a semantic choice. It is a posture choice. Measuring "stress" positions the tool as diagnostic and forward-looking. Measuring "trauma" would position it as retrospective and potentially accusatory. The tool identifies where load is accumulating; it does not diagnose what that load has done to the organisation or its people.</p>

        <h2>3. Constructs and subsystems</h2>
        <p>The tool decomposes institutional health into five subsystems. These are not exhaustive; they represent the most commonly observable and externally verifiable dimensions of institutional stress in public-sector and education contexts.</p>

        <table class="method-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Subsystem</th>
                    <th>Observable proxies</th>
                    <th>Why included</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Leadership &amp; Governance</strong></td>
                    <td>Decision quality, turnover, structural changes, acting appointments</td>
                    <td>Leadership instability is a leading indicator of systemic stress across all other dimensions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Workforce Stability</strong></td>
                    <td>Staff churn, vacancies, secondments, LOA spikes</td>
                    <td>Workforce disruption both signals and amplifies institutional strain</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Transparency &amp; Compliance</strong></td>
                    <td>FOI volume, refusal rates, processing times, deemed refusals</td>
                    <td>FOI and compliance data are the most publicly verifiable signals of governance health</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Organisational Climate</strong></td>
                    <td>Morale indicators, grievances, cultural signals, survey data</td>
                    <td>Climate captures the human experience of institutional stress that quantitative metrics miss</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>External Scrutiny</strong></td>
                    <td>Audits, OVIC, WorkSafe, Ombudsman, media</td>
                    <td>External engagement reflects both the severity and visibility of institutional problems</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>These five subsystems are informed by organisational failure literature (Reason, Vaughan, Perrow), institutional crisis theory (Boin &amp; 't Hart), safety culture frameworks (Westrum), regulatory craft (Sparrow), and responsive regulation theory (Braithwaite). They are not derived from a single model but represent a synthesis of dimensions that recur across these traditions.</p>
        <p>The subsystem decomposition reflects Reason's model of latent failures accumulating across organisational layers before surfacing as active failures. The temporal dimension — scoring across multiple time periods — draws on Perrow's thesis that in complex, tightly coupled systems, cascading failures are inherent properties of the system rather than aberrations. Vaughan's concept of normalisation of deviance explains why the timeline view matters: each tolerated deviation resets the institutional baseline, so trigger incidents compound rather than resolve.</p>
        <p>The Transparency &amp; Compliance subsystem is weighted highest (×1.3) in part because FOI data provides the strongest publicly verifiable signal. OAIC quarterly statistics show FOI refusal rates as a measurable, longitudinal indicator of governance health. Surges in FOI volume and rising refusal rates have been documented as stress signals on institutions themselves, not just on applicants.</p>

        <h2>4. Scoring scale</h2>
        <p>Each subsystem is scored on a <strong>0–3 ordinal scale</strong> per time period:</p>

        <table class="method-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Score</th>
                    <th>Band</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>0</strong></td>
                    <td>Baseline</td>
                    <td>No observable stress signals beyond normal operational variation</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>1</strong></td>
                    <td>Elevated</td>
                    <td>Early or isolated signals that may warrant monitoring</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>2</strong></td>
                    <td>Acute</td>
                    <td>Clear stress signals across multiple indicators; active concern</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>3</strong></td>
                    <td>Chronic</td>
                    <td>Sustained, cross-subsystem stress with no recovery trajectory</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>This is an <strong>ordinal scale</strong>, not interval or ratio. A score of 2 does not mean "twice as stressed" as 1. The bands represent qualitative states, not quantities. The scale is deliberately coarse — designed for triage-level pattern detection, not granular measurement.</p>

        <p>At Acute (2) and Chronic (3) levels, the tool prompts the user to record a justification note explaining what observable signal supports the rating. This is a methodological guardrail: high scores without documented reasoning are analytically weak and should be treated with caution.</p>

        <h2>5. Composite index and weighting</h2>
        <p>Individual subsystem scores are combined into a single <strong>Stress Index</strong> (0–10 scale) using a weighted arithmetic mean, normalised to the 0–10 range.</p>

        <h3>Why weights exist</h3>
        <p>Equal weighting is not neutral — it is an implicit value judgement that all subsystems contribute equally to institutional stress. Differential weighting allows the tool to reflect that some signals are more externally verifiable, more reliably observable, or more strongly predictive of systemic problems.</p>

        <h3>Current weights</h3>
        <table class="method-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>

            <strong>Sensitivity.</strong> These weights are provisional expert estimates reflecting relative signal observability and reliability. We tested whether reasonable alternative weights (including equal weighting) materially change trend shape; they generally do not, which suggests observed patterns are not weight-driven. The weighting range is deliberately narrow (1.0–1.3) to prevent any single subsystem from dominating the composite.

        <h3>Severity bands</h3>
        <p>The 0–10 Stress Index is mapped to four severity bands:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baseline</strong> (0–2.5) — Normal operational range</li>
            <li><strong>Elevated</strong> (2.5–5) — Detectable strain; monitoring warranted</li>
            <li><strong>Acute</strong> (5–7.5) — Active stress; intervention may be warranted</li>
            <li><strong>Chronic</strong> (7.5–10) — Sustained systemic stress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These bands are evenly distributed across the 0–10 scale. They represent communicative scaffolding for legibility, not empirically validated cutpoints. The graduated escalation logic draws on Ayres and Braithwaite's responsive regulation framework (1992) — the enforcement pyramid turned sideways into a diagnostic scale. Each band implies a different posture: monitoring, active attention, intervention consideration, and sustained systemic concern.</p>

        <h2>6. Data handling</h2>
        <p>All data entered into the Stress Mapper is stored locally in the user's browser (<code>localStorage</code>). No data is transmitted to GlassCase servers. Data persists across browser sessions on the same device until the user clears it or resets the tool.</p>
        <p>Users can export their data as a structured JSON file. The export includes all scores, justification notes, computed indices, and full metadata (tool version, methodology reference, disclaimer). Justification notes are user commentary — they are included in exports but are not published or shared unless the user chooses to distribute the file.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitations and non-claims</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This tool does not measure institutional health. It structures user interpretation of observable signals.</li>
            <li>Scores are ordinal, not interval. Arithmetic operations on ordinal data (including the weighted mean) are a pragmatic approximation, not a statistical claim.</li>
            <li>The five subsystems are not exhaustive. They represent commonly observable dimensions, not a complete model of institutional function.</li>
            <li>Weights are provisional. They reflect design judgement informed by the literature, not empirical calibration against outcome data.</li>
            <li>The tool does not establish causation, intent, motive, or wrongdoing.</li>
            <li>Output is not suitable for use as evidence in legal, regulatory, or administrative proceedings without independent professional verification.</li>
            <li>Narrative timelines (demonstration only) carry legal, ethical, and reputational risk. The exemplar included in the tool is entirely fictional.</li>
        </ul>
